<h1> Banking App for study </h1>
<p> I wrote this code as a small banking application in C++ to learn more about Object-Oriented programming, I tried to encapsulate some data that should not be modified and abstract some concepts related to a banking application user. 
So far, it is possible to create different users through the "holder" class, which receives another "cpf" class object (Brazilian citizen identification) in its parameters so that it can be built, and then used to create a bank account through the account class.</p>
